libtacplus-map (1.0.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Initial release of tacacs user mapping library
  * libtacplus_map APIs to support local mapping, so that TACACS users do not
    need to add TACACS+ accounts to /etc/passwd to supply home directory, uid,
    and gid. TACACS+ users are mapped by privilege level to local tacacs0..15
